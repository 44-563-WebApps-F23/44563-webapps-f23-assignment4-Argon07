        <p><b>MRS. ALVING. </b>
                <h5>[Drumming on the window frame.] </h5> I ought never to have
                concealed the facts of Alving's life. But at that time I dared not
                do anything else--I was afraid, partly on my own account. I was such a
                coward.</p><br>
        <p><b>MANDERS.</b>
            A coward?</p><br>
        <p><b>MRS. ALVING.</b>
                If people had come to know anything, they would have said--"Poor man! with a runaway wife, 
                no wonder he kicks over thetraces."</p><br>
        <p><b>MANDERS.</b> 
            Such remarks might have been made with a certain show of right.</p><br>
        <p><b>MRS. ALVING.</b>
                <h5>[Looking steadily at him.]</h5>If I were what I ought to be, I
                should go to Oswald and say, "Listen, my boy: your father led a vicious
                life--"</p><br>
        <p><b>MANDERS.</b>
            Merciful heavens--!</p><br>
